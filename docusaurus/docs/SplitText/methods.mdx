### `split`

Splits the text into letters, words, and optionally lines based on configuration.

The method is automatically called on initialization, though it can be manually called at any time.

```ts
const text = new SplitText({ container });

text.split();
```

### `destroy`

Destroys the instance and cleans up resources.

```ts
const text = new SplitText({ container });

text.destroy();
```
