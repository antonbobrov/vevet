# Methods

:::note
All **[Module methods](/docs/base/Module/#methods)** are available in this class.
:::

### `pause`

Pause the timeline, halting progress without resetting it.

```ts
const tm = new Timeline();

tm.pause();
```

### `play`

Play the timeline, advancing progress **from the current value toward `1`.**

Notes:

- If the timeline is reversed, calling `play()` switches it to forward mode.
- Does nothing if the timeline is already playing or destroyed.

```ts
const tm = new Timeline();

tm.play();
```

### `reset`

Reset the timeline to the beginning (`progress = 0`).

```ts
const tm = new Timeline();

tm.reset();
```

### `reverse`

Reverse the timeline, moving progress **from the current value toward `0`.**

Notes:

- If the timeline is playing forward, calling `reverse()` switches direction.
- Does nothing if progress is already `0` or the instance is destroyed.

```ts
const tm = new Timeline();

tm.reverse();
```

### `destroy`

Destroys the instance and cleans up resources.

```ts
const tm = new Timeline();

tm.destroy();
```
