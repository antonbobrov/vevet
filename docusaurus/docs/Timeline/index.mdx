# Timeline

A simple timeline class for managing animations with easing and precise progress control.

It provides methods for playing, reversing, pausing, and resetting the timeline.

## Basic Demo

<iframe
  height="600"
  style={{
    width: '100%',
  }}
  scrolling="no"
  title="Vevet Demo"

## Initialization

:::caution

- `Timeline` does not work with DOM elements or styles — **it performs time and easing calculations only.**
- Animation is **disabled by default.** You must explicitly call `.play()` to start it.
- `Timeline` does **not run automatically** on creation, even if callbacks are provided.
- The timeline operates in the range **0 → 1**, regardless of duration.
  :::

```js
import { Timeline } from 'vevet';

const tm = new Timeline(
  { duration: 350, easing: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1] },
  {
    onUpdate: ({ eased }) => {
      // your animation here
    },
  },
);

tm.play();

tm.pause();
```

Destroy the instance:

```js
tm.destroy();
```
