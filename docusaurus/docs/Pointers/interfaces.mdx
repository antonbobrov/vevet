interface IPointersItem {
  id: number; // Native pointerId from the browser.
  index: number; // Index assigned to the pointer.
  start: IPointersVec2; // Coordinates recorded on pointerdown.
  prev: IPointersVec2; // Coordinates from the previous update cycle.
  current: IPointersVec2; // Latest coordinates of the pointer.
  diff: IPointersVec2; // Difference between current and start positions.
  step: IPointersVec2; // Movement delta between current and prev.
  accum: IPointersVec2; // Total accumulated movement across all updates.
}
```

## IPointersVec2

```ts
interface IPointersVec2 {
  x: number; // X-coordinate relative to the container.
  y: number; // Y-coordinate relative to the container.
}
